# Circle In App

## Prerequisites

You will need yarn globally (this avoids dependency errors that occur when using bare npm commands with this project):

```sh
npm install yarn -g
```

The installed yarn version should be 1.22 or above:

```sh
yarn -v
```

The installed node version should be 12-14 (the current version of node is not compatible with webpack 4):

```sh
node -v
```

## Getting started

To install and build the project:

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```
